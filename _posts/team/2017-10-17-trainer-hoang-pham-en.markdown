During his Vovinam career, he has attent several Vovinam seminars and championships in Italy and also abroad:

- EVVF-Seminar in Frankfurt am Main in May 2016.

In October 2015, he moved to Potsdam, Germany to work permanently as a Software Developer in a startup located in Berlin. Since Berlin has no Vovinam presence, he has to train his neighbour's son in a park in Potsdam. In April 2016, he moved to live in Lichstenberg district, Berlin. After the EVVF seminar in Frankfurt am Main, he met master Tran Dai Chieu, 6th Dang, Vice president of German Vovinam Viet Vo Dao Federation [DVVF](http://www.vovinam-in-dvvf.eu/). Master Chieu suggested him to open a Vovinam class in Berlin to teach beginners Vovinam techniques. With great help and support from master Chieu, he contacted Mr. Hoang Vinh, the previous maintainer of the Vovinam Berlin group, and resurrected the Vovinam movement in Berlin. First class started in June 2016 in a Driving school in Dong Xuan Center (Fahrschule Hoan Kiem).

In September 2016, he was accepted to open a new Vovinam department in S.V. Tora club, and became the leader of the department. Since then, the club trains 3 times per week in Lichstenberg district and Friedrichshain district in Berlin.
